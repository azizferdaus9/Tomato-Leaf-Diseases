# Tomato-Leaf-Diseases

**Objective:** The project aims to develop a robust deep learning solution for the accurate classification of tomato leaf diseases, crucial for maintaining agricultural productivity and food security.

**Problem Statement:** Prompt detection and classification of plant diseases are essential to mitigate their adverse impacts on agriculture, ecology, and economy. However, traditional methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming.

**Methodology:**

**Dataset:** Utilized a dataset comprising 60,000 images of tomato leaves affected by ten different diseases and healthy leaves.
**Approach:** Implemented novel ensemble deep learning architectures, specifically a hybrid transfer learning model (XSVC), combining the strengths of transfer learning and conventional machine learning techniques.
**Results:** Achieved a remarkable accuracy of 99.51% with the XSVC model, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.
**Innovation:** Developed an Android application for disease prediction, enabling users to upload tomato leaf photos for quick diagnosis using the XSVC model.
**Impact:** This research significantly advances the field of plant disease diagnosis by providing precise, efficient, and accessible solutions for early disease detection and classification in agricultural settings.

**Outcome:** The project contributes to sustainable agriculture by empowering farmers with technology-driven tools to enhance crop health management and mitigate yield losses due to diseases.

**Key Contributions:**

Developed and optimized deep learning models for accurate classification of tomato leaf diseases.
Implemented a user-friendly Android application for real-time disease prediction using the trained model.
Published experimental findings showcasing superior performance compared to existing methodologies.
**Future Directions:** Future work could focus on expanding the dataset to include more diverse environmental conditions and diseases, enhancing the model's robustness and generalizability.

This project underscores the potential of deep learning in transforming agricultural practices through advanced disease detection and management techniques.
